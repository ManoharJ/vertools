Source files for vertools collection; 
First pass package has only source (no examples, tests, etc)

To build programs, either call make for each one (using <prog>.makefile) 
or call the script that calls make in a loop:

    make_all_makes.csh


Note that some programs FAIL TO BUILD; These require extra libraries to link.

    Venpipe needs the Vienna RNA library
    Plotmat needs the gd graphics library
