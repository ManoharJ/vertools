-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
To build programs, either call make for each one (using <prog>.makefile) 
or call the script that calls make in a loop:

    scripts/make_all_makes.sh

To copy / move resulting binaries to some directory (e.g. "~/vertools/"):
    
    find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -perm -100 -exec cp {} ~/vertools/ \;

    find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -perm -100 -exec mv {} ~/vertools/ \;
    

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note that some programs FAIL TO BUILD; These require extra libraries to link.
